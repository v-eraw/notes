# Database Migrations

_Database migration_ is the process of migrating data from one or more source databases to one or more target databases by using a database migration service. When a migration is finished, the dataset in the source databases resides fully, though possibly restructured, in the target databases. Clients that accessed the source databases are then switched over to the target databases, and the source databases are turned down.
