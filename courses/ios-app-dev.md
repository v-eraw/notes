# iOS App Dev

I'm going through the iOS app dev source on Udemy taught by Dr. Angela Yu and so far I'm really having fun. It's probably the best tutorial/online class I've taken. I appreciate how she takes the time to talk about how to be efficient and selective with the kinds of tutorials you go through. I've definitely made the mistake of spending too much time on a tutorial that goes over my head or just doesn't click with me and makes me feel like I've wasted my time when I don't understand the material.
