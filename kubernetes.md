# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available

When you deploy Kubernetes, you get a **cluster**.

A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called [nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/), that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.

The worker node(s) host the [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) that are the components of the application workload. The [control plane](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-control-plane) manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster. In production environments, the control plane usually runs across multiple computers and a cluster usually runs multiple nodes, providing fault-tolerance and high availability.
