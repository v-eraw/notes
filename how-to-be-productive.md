# how to be productive

it's kinda strict + far from what I currently do but I suppose the ideal is this:

### Productivity

* Focusing is very important for productivity
  * Eliminate any possible distraction before starting
* Plan out entire week in small tasks that take no more than two hours
* Pick your tasks from this list at the beginning of every day
* Use kanban board which consists of states like “Not started,” “In progress,” and “Done.”
* Ignore emails during the day
* Don't use chat programs during the day
* Use pomodoro technique
  * Set a goal for number of pomodoris you can do each day
    * First benefit: You should prioritize your tasks since you have limited number of pomodoris
    * Second benefit: You can relax when you hit your target. You don't need to feel guilty anymore
    * Author's goal is 10 pomodori per day
* Use quota system
  * List all your recurring tasks
  * Set quotas for how many times the task should be done during an interval.
  * Examples quotas:
    * run three times each week
    * get 50 pomodori done each week
* Don't multitask
  * Batch tasks such as writing emails, making phone calls, fixing bugs, meetings
* Biggest time wasters
  * Watching TV
  * Social media
  * News sites
  * Unnecessary meetings
  * Cooking
  * Playing videogames (especially online games)
  * Coffee breaks
*   Have a routine

    * Sample routine

* Use the power of habit
* Decompose large problems into smaller tasks
* Don't procrastinate. Get in the habit of not delaying, but immediately executing on work that needs to be done.
* Take action
  * Don't fear of being wrong.
  * Ask always: “What is the worst that could happen?”
