# Content Delivery Network (CDN)

Makes your website faster (always a plus).

A CDN is **a network of servers that distributes content from an “origin” server throughout the world by caching content close to where each end user is accessing the internet via a web-enabled device**. The content they request is first stored on the origin server and is then replicated and stored elsewhere as needed.
