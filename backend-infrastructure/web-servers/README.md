# Web Servers

Server-side web frameworks provide a lot of "common" web server functionality that you might otherwise have to implement yourself (e.g. support for sessions, support for users and authentication, easy database access, templating libraries, etc.)

Server-side programming allows developers to make use of **sessions** â€” basically, a mechanism that allows a server to store information on the current user of a site and send different responses based on that information.
