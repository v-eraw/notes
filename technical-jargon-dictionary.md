# Technical Jargon Dictionary

**paradigm** - widely accepted example, belief, concept, or pattern. in a sense, what already exists/is known/is used. emphasis on it being a concept.

* Imperative: Programming with an explicit sequence of commands that update state.
* Declarative: Programming by specifying the result you want, not how to get it.
* Structured: Programming with clean, goto-free, nested control structures.
* Procedural: Imperative programming with procedure calls.
* Functional (Applicative): Programming with function calls that avoid any global state.
* Function-Level (Combinator): Programming with no variables at all.
* Object-Oriented: Programming by defining objects that send messages to each other. Objects have their own internal (encapsulated) state and public interfaces. Object orientation can be:
  * **Class-based**: Objects get state and behavior based on membership in a class.
  * **Prototype-based**: Objects get behavior from a prototype object.
* Event-Driven: Programming with emitters and listeners of asynchronous actions.
* Flow-Driven: Programming processes communicating with each other over predefined channels.
* Logic (Rule-based): Programming by specifying a set of facts and rules. An engine infers the answers to questions.
* Constraint: Programming by specifying a set of constraints. An engine finds the values that meet the constraints.
* Aspect-Oriented: Programming cross-cutting concerns applied transparently.
* Reflective: Programming by manipulating the program elements themselves.
* Array: Programming with powerful array operators that usually make loops unnecessary.
